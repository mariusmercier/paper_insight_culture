He has no idea where the chocolates came from, and is all the more surprised that he really doesn&rsquo;t like chocolate. As he looks for someone to give the chocolates to, he turns to his chubby friend at the club, Mr. Beresford.

Here&rsquo;s the reasoning of the detective behind the arrest: - How likely would you be to share this story and explanation with other people?","Timing - The old billionaire Edward Conway has invited the famous detective Richard Burton to his home. Mr. Conway lives in an isolated mansion. When he arrives, Burton sees three workers moving rubble in front of the house. On the steps, the butler, Murray, opens the door and explains that the house is being renovated. He apologizes for the inconvenience, and Burton shows him the invitation he received from Mr. Conway.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> Murray informs Burton that it is standard procedure to introduce visitors first to the office of the secretary who notifies Mr. Conway of their visit, and he brings Burton to the secretary&rsquo;s office. Burton knocks on the door and an authoritative voice tells him to enter. Once inside, a tall, austere, bespectacled man greets the detective, coldly. It is not the secretary who is there, but Mr. Conway. He explains to Burton that he is using his secretary&#39;s office because there is currently work going on in his own office, and asks him to sit. Burton does so, facing a large window, where a strong sun is setting.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> For several weeks he has been having the same dream, Mr. Conway says. In this nightmare, he is killing himself in front of his office window with the gun he keeps in his drawer. Not being suicidal, Mr. Conway asks Burton if he has ever encountered cases of murder by suggestion. Mr. Conway wonders if someone could use hypnosis to drive him to suicide by making him dream of ending his life, although he does not remember being hypnotized. He mentions a number of business rivals whom he ruined, and who might want to seek revenge in this perverted manner.<br /> <br /> Burton is taken aback because he has never encountered such a case and admits that he&rsquo;s not sure whether he can help Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway then dismisses the detective and asks him to give back the invitation, as he wants to keep this meeting discreet. However, once Burton is in the hallway, he realizes that he has actually given another letter, addressed to a colleague. Therefore, he goes back to the office, gives the right letter to Mr. Conway, apologizes and goes home.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> A week later, Mr. Conway is found dead by apparent suicide. On the same day, the police called Burton to the scene because his letter of invitation had been found on Mr. Conway&#39;s table. Once he gets there, he notices that the work is finished, and that the workers have done a good job cleaning up, except for a few pieces of glass on the landing of the house that his experienced eye can&rsquo;t help but notice. Mr. Conway used to water the plants on his windowsill at 1 p.m. sharp every day, and the plants had been watered. Therefore, Mr. Conway&#39;s time of death is most likely after 1 p.m. In the house, in addition to the police, are Mr. Conway&#39;s widow, and his daughter from a previous marriage, as well as the butler Murray, the cleaning lady Miss Hurtigan and his secretary Mr. Fisher.<br /> <br /> Burton first tells the police the contents of his conversation with Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway&#39;s widow confirms that her husband had been preoccupied in recent weeks by recurring dreams of suicide. The detective is then introduced to Mr. Conway&#39;s office, which is next to his secretary&rsquo;s, entering through a large carved door. Mr. Conway&#39;s body is lying in front of his open window, holding a revolver in his hand, dead from a bullet to the head. The body was discovered by Mr. Fisher, who had come to bring him a briefcase of documents, followed a few seconds later by Murray, who was alerted by Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s cry. The body is not wearing glasses, which is strange because Mr. Conway, being extremely short-sighted, rarely took off his glasses. This absence of glasses is all the more puzzling because Mr. Conway had a spare pair in case he lost the first one.<br /> <br /> None of the workers heard the shot, which is probably due to them wearing noise-cancelling headphones, the noise of the work, and the heavy door of Mr. Conway office. Despite the back and forth of the workers in front of Conway&#39;s office, no one saw anyone enter Mr. Conway&#39;s office&ndash;except Mr. Conway himself earlier in the morning. For most of the day of the shooting, Betsy Conway and Miss. Conway said they were either in another aisle, as the work near Mr. Conway&rsquo;s office was quite noisy. Mr. Conway has kept working there, thanks to the heavy insulation of his office. Fisher, Murray and Hurtigan, to be able to keep working, had borrowed noise-cancelling headphones from the workers and continued their tasks as usual. As a result, no one seems to have heard the gunshot.<br /> <br /> Mr. Conway&#39;s daughter and widow each inherit half of the deceased&#39;s considerable fortune. They do not seem particularly distraught, possibly because Mr. Conway was notorious for his bad temper.<br /> <br /> A few days later, Burton contacted the police and told them the following: - Timing - First Click","Timing - The old billionaire Edward Conway has invited the famous detective Richard Burton to his home.

Mr. Conway lives in an isolated mansion. When he arrives, Burton sees three workers moving rubble in front of the house. On the steps, the butler, Murray, opens the door and explains that the house is being renovated. He apologizes for the inconvenience, and Burton shows him the invitation he received from Mr. Conway.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> Murray informs Burton that it is standard procedure to introduce visitors first to the office of the secretary who notifies Mr. Conway of their visit, and he brings Burton to the secretary&rsquo;s office. Burton knocks on the door and an authoritative voice tells him to enter. Once inside, a tall, austere, bespectacled man greets the detective, coldly. It is not the secretary who is there, but Mr. Conway.

Burton does so, facing a large window, where a strong sun is setting.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> For several weeks he has been having the same dream, Mr. Conway says. In this nightmare, he is killing himself in front of his office window with the gun he keeps in his drawer. Not being suicidal, Mr. Conway asks Burton if he has ever encountered cases of murder by suggestion. Mr. Conway wonders if someone could use hypnosis to drive him to suicide by making him dream of ending his life, although he does not remember being hypnotized.

Mr. Conway then dismisses the detective and asks him to give back the invitation, as he wants to keep this meeting discreet.

Here&rsquo;s the reasoning of the detective behind the arrest: - How likely would you be to share this story and explanation with other people?","Timing - The old billionaire Edward Conway has invited the famous detective Richard Burton to his home. Mr. Conway lives in an isolated mansion. When he arrives, Burton sees three workers moving rubble in front of the house. On the steps, the butler, Murray, opens the door and explains that the house is being renovated. He apologizes for the inconvenience, and Burton shows him the invitation he received from Mr. Conway.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> Murray informs Burton that it is standard procedure to introduce visitors first to the office of the secretary who notifies Mr. Conway of their visit, and he brings Burton to the secretary&rsquo;s office. Burton knocks on the door and an authoritative voice tells him to enter. Once inside, a tall, austere, bespectacled man greets the detective, coldly. It is not the secretary who is there, but Mr. Conway. He explains to Burton that he is using his secretary&#39;s office because there is currently work going on in his own office, and asks him to sit. Burton does so, facing a large window, where a strong sun is setting.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> For several weeks he has been having the same dream, Mr. Conway says. In this nightmare, he is killing himself in front of his office window with the gun he keeps in his drawer. Not being suicidal, Mr. Conway asks Burton if he has ever encountered cases of murder by suggestion. Mr. Conway wonders if someone could use hypnosis to drive him to suicide by making him dream of ending his life, although he does not remember being hypnotized. He mentions a number of business rivals whom he ruined, and who might want to seek revenge in this perverted manner.<br /> <br /> Burton is taken aback because he has never encountered such a case and admits that he&rsquo;s not sure whether he can help Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway then dismisses the detective and asks him to give back the invitation, as he wants to keep this meeting discreet. However, once Burton is in the hallway, he realizes that he has actually given another letter, addressed to a colleague. Therefore, he goes back to the office, gives the right letter to Mr. Conway, apologizes and goes home.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> A week later, Mr. Conway is found dead by apparent suicide. On the same day, the police called Burton to the scene because his letter of invitation had been found on Mr. Conway&#39;s table. Once he gets there, he notices that the work is finished, and that the workers have done a good job cleaning up, except for a few pieces of glass on the landing of the house that his experienced eye can&rsquo;t help but notice. Mr. Conway used to water the plants on his windowsill at 1 p.m. sharp every day, and the plants had been watered. Therefore, Mr. Conway&#39;s time of death is most likely after 1 p.m. In the house, in addition to the police, are Mr. Conway&#39;s widow, and his daughter from a previous marriage, as well as the butler Murray, the cleaning lady Miss Hurtigan and his secretary Mr. Fisher.<br /> <br /> Burton first tells the police the contents of his conversation with Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway&#39;s widow confirms that her husband had been preoccupied in recent weeks by recurring dreams of suicide. The detective is then introduced to Mr. Conway&#39;s office, which is next to his secretary&rsquo;s, entering through a large carved door. Mr. Conway&#39;s body is lying in front of his open window, holding a revolver in his hand, dead from a bullet to the head. The body was discovered by Mr. Fisher, who had come to bring him a briefcase of documents, followed a few seconds later by Murray, who was alerted by Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s cry. The body is not wearing glasses, which is strange because Mr. Conway, being extremely short-sighted, rarely took off his glasses. This absence of glasses is all the more puzzling because Mr. Conway had a spare pair in case he lost the first one.<br /> <br /> None of the workers heard the shot, which is probably due to them wearing noise-cancelling headphones, the noise of the work, and the heavy door of Mr. Conway office. Despite the back and forth of the workers in front of Conway&#39;s office, no one saw anyone enter Mr. Conway&#39;s office&ndash;except Mr. Conway himself earlier in the morning.

Mr. Conway lives in an isolated mansion. When he arrives, Burton sees three workers moving rubble in front of the house. On the steps, the butler, Murray, opens the door and explains that the house is being renovated. He apologizes for the inconvenience, and Burton shows him the invitation he received from Mr. Conway.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> Murray informs Burton that it is standard procedure to introduce visitors first to the office of the secretary who notifies Mr. Conway of their visit, and he brings Burton to the secretary&rsquo;s office. Burton knocks on the door and an authoritative voice tells him to enter. Once inside, a tall, austere, bespectacled man greets the detective, coldly. It is not the secretary who is there, but Mr. Conway. He explains to Burton that he is using his secretary&#39;s office because there is currently work going on in his own office, and asks him to sit. Burton does so, facing a large window, where a strong sun is setting.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> For several weeks he has been having the same dream, Mr. Conway says. In this nightmare, he is killing himself in front of his office window with the gun he keeps in his drawer. Not being suicidal, Mr. Conway asks Burton if he has ever encountered cases of murder by suggestion. Mr. Conway wonders if someone could use hypnosis to drive him to suicide by making him dream of ending his life, although he does not remember being hypnotized. He mentions a number of business rivals whom he ruined, and who might want to seek revenge in this perverted manner.<br /> <br /> Burton is taken aback because he has never encountered such a case and admits that he&rsquo;s not sure whether he can help Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway then dismisses the detective and asks him to give back the invitation, as he wants to keep this meeting discreet. However, once Burton is in the hallway, he realizes that he has actually given another letter, addressed to a colleague. Therefore, he goes back to the office, gives the right letter to Mr. Conway, apologizes and goes home.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> A week later, Mr. Conway is found dead by apparent suicide.

Mr. Conway used to water the plants on his windowsill at 1 p.m. sharp every day, and the plants had been watered. Therefore, Mr. Conway&#39;s time of death is most likely after 1 p.m. In the house, in addition to the police, are Mr. Conway&#39;s widow, and his daughter from a previous marriage, as well as the butler Murray, the cleaning lady Miss Hurtigan and his secretary Mr. Fisher.<br /> <br /> Burton first tells the police the contents of his conversation with Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway&#39;s widow confirms that her husband had been preoccupied in recent weeks by recurring dreams of suicide.

Mr. Conway&#39;s body is lying in front of his open window, holding a revolver in his hand, dead from a bullet to the head. The body was discovered by Mr. Fisher, who had come to bring him a briefcase of documents, followed a few seconds later by Murray, who was alerted by Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s cry.
