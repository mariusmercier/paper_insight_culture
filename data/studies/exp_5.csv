He has no idea where the chocolates came from, and is all the more surprised that he really doesn&rsquo;t like chocolate. As he looks for someone to give the chocolates to, he turns to his chubby friend at the club, Mr. Beresford. Sir William tells him:&nbsp;<br /> <br /> - &quot;You mentioned that you were looking for a small gift for your wife, so I&rsquo;d happily give you those, are you interested?&quot;<br /> <br /> Mr. Beresford replies:<br /> <br /> - &quot;If you&rsquo;d asked me that last week, I would have said, absolutely not, as my wife was until then on a strict no-sugar diet. Fortunately, she&rsquo;s done with that, and we can enjoy delicacies together again. So if you absolutely don&rsquo;t want the chocolate box, I&rsquo;d happily take it off you!&quot;<br /> <br /> As a result, Sir Williams gives Mr. Beresford the chocolate box.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Mr. Beresford goes home and, after dinner, he gives his wife the chocolates, and they enjoy a few together while watching a movie. During the night, they both feel sick, and Mr. Beresford manages to call an ambulance. Tragically, Mrs. Beresford dies on the way to the hospital, while Mr. Beresford is severely sick but survives after days of treatment.<br /> <br /> The police establish that the death of Mrs. Beresford, and the sickness of her husband, is due to the chocolates, which had been poisoned with nitrobenzene.

Mrs. Beresford ate a dozen chocolates, while her husband ate only two, which saved his life. Police traced the chocolates back to the small, luxury Maison Fauchon chocolate company that made them. It turns out that Sir William&#39;s box of chocolates was part of a special request from an unknown customer.

Here&rsquo;s the reasoning of the detective behind the arrest: - How likely would you be to share this story and explanation with other people?","Timing - The old billionaire Edward Conway has invited the famous detective Richard Burton to his home. Mr. Conway lives in an isolated mansion. When he arrives, Burton sees three workers moving rubble in front of the house. On the steps, the butler, Murray, opens the door and explains that the house is being renovated. He apologizes for the inconvenience, and Burton shows him the invitation he received from Mr. Conway.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> Murray informs Burton that it is standard procedure to introduce visitors first to the office of the secretary who notifies Mr. Conway of their visit, and he brings Burton to the secretary&rsquo;s office. Burton knocks on the door and an authoritative voice tells him to enter. Once inside, a tall, austere, bespectacled man greets the detective, coldly. It is not the secretary who is there, but Mr. Conway. He explains to Burton that he is using his secretary&#39;s office because there is currently work going on in his own office, and asks him to sit. Burton does so, facing a large window, where a strong sun is setting.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> For several weeks he has been having the same dream, Mr. Conway says. In this nightmare, he is killing himself in front of his office window with the gun he keeps in his drawer. Not being suicidal, Mr. Conway asks Burton if he has ever encountered cases of murder by suggestion. Mr. Conway wonders if someone could use hypnosis to drive him to suicide by making him dream of ending his life, although he does not remember being hypnotized. He mentions a number of business rivals whom he ruined, and who might want to seek revenge in this perverted manner.<br /> <br /> Burton is taken aback because he has never encountered such a case and admits that he&rsquo;s not sure whether he can help Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway then dismisses the detective and asks him to give back the invitation, as he wants to keep this meeting discreet. However, once Burton is in the hallway, he realizes that he has actually given another letter, addressed to a colleague. Therefore, he goes back to the office, gives the right letter to Mr. Conway, apologizes and goes home.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> A week later, Mr. Conway is found dead by apparent suicide. On the same day, the police called Burton to the scene because his letter of invitation had been found on Mr. Conway&#39;s table. Once he gets there, he notices that the work is finished, and that the workers have done a good job cleaning up, except for a few pieces of glass on the landing of the house that his experienced eye can&rsquo;t help but notice. Mr. Conway used to water the plants on his windowsill at 1 p.m. sharp every day, and the plants had been watered. Therefore, Mr. Conway&#39;s time of death is most likely after 1 p.m. In the house, in addition to the police, are Mr. Conway&#39;s widow, and his daughter from a previous marriage, as well as the butler Murray, the cleaning lady Miss Hurtigan and his secretary Mr. Fisher.<br /> <br /> Burton first tells the police the contents of his conversation with Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway&#39;s widow confirms that her husband had been preoccupied in recent weeks by recurring dreams of suicide. The detective is then introduced to Mr. Conway&#39;s office, which is next to his secretary&rsquo;s, entering through a large carved door. Mr. Conway&#39;s body is lying in front of his open window, holding a revolver in his hand, dead from a bullet to the head. The body was discovered by Mr. Fisher, who had come to bring him a briefcase of documents, followed a few seconds later by Murray, who was alerted by Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s cry.

Mr. Conway lives in an isolated mansion. When he arrives, Burton sees three workers moving rubble in front of the house. On the steps, the butler, Murray, opens the door and explains that the house is being renovated. He apologizes for the inconvenience, and Burton shows him the invitation he received from Mr. Conway.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> Murray informs Burton that it is standard procedure to introduce visitors first to the office of the secretary who notifies Mr. Conway of their visit, and he brings Burton to the secretary&rsquo;s office. Burton knocks on the door and an authoritative voice tells him to enter. Once inside, a tall, austere, bespectacled man greets the detective, coldly. It is not the secretary who is there, but Mr. Conway.

Mr. Conway wonders if someone could use hypnosis to drive him to suicide by making him dream of ending his life, although he does not remember being hypnotized.

Therefore, he goes back to the office, gives the right letter to Mr. Conway, apologizes and goes home.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> A week later, Mr. Conway is found dead by apparent suicide. On the same day, the police called Burton to the scene because his letter of invitation had been found on Mr. Conway&#39;s table.

Mr. Conway used to water the plants on his windowsill at 1 p.m. sharp every day, and the plants had been watered. Therefore, Mr. Conway&#39;s time of death is most likely after 1 p.m. In the house, in addition to the police, are Mr. Conway&#39;s widow, and his daughter from a previous marriage, as well as the butler Murray, the cleaning lady Miss Hurtigan and his secretary Mr. Fisher.<br /> <br /> Burton first tells the police the contents of his conversation with Mr. Conway.

Mr. Conway used to water the plants on his windowsill at 1 p.m. sharp every day, and the plants had been watered. Therefore, Mr. Conway&#39;s time of death is most likely after 1 p.m. In the house, in addition to the police, are Mr. Conway&#39;s widow, and his daughter from a previous marriage, as well as the butler Murray, the cleaning lady Miss Hurtigan and his secretary Mr. Fisher.<br /> <br /> Burton first tells the police the contents of his conversation with Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway&#39;s widow confirms that her husband had been preoccupied in recent weeks by recurring dreams of suicide. The detective is then introduced to Mr. Conway&#39;s office, which is next to his secretary&rsquo;s, entering through a large carved door. Mr. Conway&#39;s body is lying in front of his open window, holding a revolver in his hand, dead from a bullet to the head. The body was discovered by Mr. Fisher, who had come to bring him a briefcase of documents, followed a few seconds later by Murray, who was alerted by Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s cry. The body is not wearing glasses, which is strange because Mr. Conway, being extremely short-sighted, rarely took off his glasses. This absence of glasses is all the more puzzling because Mr. Conway had a spare pair in case he lost the first one.<br /> <br /> None of the workers heard the shot, which is probably due to them wearing noise-cancelling headphones, the noise of the work, and the heavy door of Mr. Conway office. Despite the back and forth of the workers in front of Conway&#39;s office, no one saw anyone enter Mr. Conway&#39;s office&ndash;except Mr. Conway himself earlier in the morning. For most of the day of the shooting, Betsy Conway and Miss. Conway said they were either in another aisle, as the work near Mr. Conway&rsquo;s office was quite noisy. Mr. Conway has kept working there, thanks to the heavy insulation of his office. Fisher, Murray and Hurtigan, to be able to keep working, had borrowed noise-cancelling headphones from the workers and continued their tasks as usual. As a result, no one seems to have heard the gunshot.<br /> <br /> Mr. Conway&#39;s daughter and widow each inherit half of the deceased&#39;s considerable fortune. They do not seem particularly distraught, possibly because Mr. Conway was notorious for his bad temper.<br /> <br /> A few days later, Burton contacted the police and told them the following: - How likely would you be to share this story and explanation with other people?","Timing - It&#39;s the beginning of a very hot summer, and Claire has just broken up with her boyfriend. They had been together for a very long time, and he took it really hard, becoming nearly abusive. To find a distraction, Claire invited Juliana, her best friend, to go out for drinks together. Juliana insisted on going to the blue lagoon, because they serve delicious, ice cold cocktails here.<br /> <br /> At the blue lagoon, they ordered one large drink to be shared between the two of them.

He has no idea where the chocolates came from, and is all the more surprised that he really doesn&rsquo;t like chocolate. As he looks for someone to give the chocolates to, he turns to his chubby friend at the club, Mr. Beresford. Sir William tells him:&nbsp;<br /> <br /> - &quot;You mentioned that you were looking for a small gift for your wife, so I&rsquo;d happily give you those, are you interested?&quot;<br /> <br /> Mr. Beresford replies:<br /> <br /> - &quot;If you&rsquo;d asked me that last week, I would have said, absolutely not, as my wife was until then on a strict no-sugar diet. Fortunately, she&rsquo;s done with that, and we can enjoy delicacies together again. So if you absolutely don&rsquo;t want the chocolate box, I&rsquo;d happily take it off you!&quot;<br /> <br /> As a result, Sir Williams gives Mr. Beresford the chocolate box.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Mr. Beresford goes home and, after dinner, he gives his wife the chocolates, and they enjoy a few together while watching a movie.

Tragically, Mrs. Beresford dies on the way to the hospital, while Mr. Beresford is severely sick but survives after days of treatment.<br /> <br /> The police establish that the death of Mrs. Beresford, and the sickness of her husband, is due to the chocolates, which had been poisoned with nitrobenzene. Given the average dose of nitrobenzene in a chocolate, six chocolates would have been enough to kill an adult. Mrs. Beresford ate a dozen chocolates, while her husband ate only two, which saved his life. Police traced the chocolates back to the small, luxury Maison Fauchon chocolate company that made them. It turns out that Sir William&#39;s box of chocolates was part of a special request from an unknown customer.

He said that after his wife&rsquo;s death, he found proof that she had been having a passionate affair with Sir William. Looking at the evidence, the police confirmed that this was the case, and they also found, in secret texts that no one had access to, that she had put a stop to the affair two weeks before her death, and that she and Sir William had had no contact since. Mr. Beresford then accused Sir Willam of poisoning his wife, so the affair wouldn&rsquo;t come out, as the latter would then be sure to lose most of his fortune in the divorce proceedings.

Sir William tells him:&nbsp;<br /> <br /> - &quot;You mentioned that you were looking for a small gift for your wife, so I&rsquo;d happily give you those, are you interested?&quot;<br /> <br /> Mr. Beresford replies:<br /> <br /> - &quot;If you&rsquo;d asked me that last week, I would have said, absolutely not, as my wife was until then on a strict no-sugar diet. Fortunately, she&rsquo;s done with that, and we can enjoy delicacies together again. So if you absolutely don&rsquo;t want the chocolate box, I&rsquo;d happily take it off you!&quot;<br /> <br /> As a result, Sir Williams gives Mr. Beresford the chocolate box.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Mr. Beresford goes home and, after dinner, he gives his wife the chocolates, and they enjoy a few together while watching a movie. During the night, they both feel sick, and Mr. Beresford manages to call an ambulance. Tragically, Mrs. Beresford dies on the way to the hospital, while Mr. Beresford is severely sick but survives after days of treatment.<br /> <br /> The police establish that the death of Mrs. Beresford, and the sickness of her husband, is due to the chocolates, which had been poisoned with nitrobenzene. Given the average dose of nitrobenzene in a chocolate, six chocolates would have been enough to kill an adult. Mrs. Beresford ate a dozen chocolates, while her husband ate only two, which saved his life. Police traced the chocolates back to the small, luxury Maison Fauchon chocolate company that made them. It turns out that Sir William&#39;s box of chocolates was part of a special request from an unknown customer. The delivery man from the Maison Fauchon remembered the order, because he had been specifically instructed to leave the chocolate box in a park bench, which he thought was weird, given that these are expensive chocolates.<br /> <br /> The police weren&rsquo;t able to prove anyone&rsquo;s guilt at first, when Mr. Beresford started making some strong accusations. He said that after his wife&rsquo;s death, he found proof that she had been having a passionate affair with Sir William. Looking at the evidence, the police confirmed that this was the case, and they also found, in secret texts that no one had access to, that she had put a stop to the affair two weeks before her death, and that she and Sir William had had no contact since. Mr. Beresford then accused Sir Willam of poisoning his wife, so the affair wouldn&rsquo;t come out, as the latter would then be sure to lose most of his fortune in the divorce proceedings. According to Mr. Beresford, Sir William ordered the chocolates, poisoned them, and then paid a henchman to deliver them to the club. He then found an excuse to give them to someone else, making it look like he was the intended victim.<br /> <br /> In spite of these accusations, the police end up arresting Mr. Beresford. Here&rsquo;s the reasoning of the detective behind the arrest: - To what extent are you interested in seeing one more story similar to the one you just saw?","Sir William, a wealthy middle-aged man in the midst of a bitter divorce, receives at his club a box of chocolates, delivered by an anonymous courier.

Here&rsquo;s the reasoning of the detective behind the arrest: - How likely would you be to share this story and explanation with other people?","Timing - The old billionaire Edward Conway has invited the famous detective Richard Burton to his home. Mr. Conway lives in an isolated mansion. When he arrives, Burton sees three workers moving rubble in front of the house. On the steps, the butler, Murray, opens the door and explains that the house is being renovated. He apologizes for the inconvenience, and Burton shows him the invitation he received from Mr. Conway.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> Murray informs Burton that it is standard procedure to introduce visitors first to the office of the secretary who notifies Mr. Conway of their visit, and he brings Burton to the secretary&rsquo;s office. Burton knocks on the door and an authoritative voice tells him to enter. Once inside, a tall, austere, bespectacled man greets the detective, coldly. It is not the secretary who is there, but Mr. Conway. He explains to Burton that he is using his secretary&#39;s office because there is currently work going on in his own office, and asks him to sit. Burton does so, facing a large window, where a strong sun is setting.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> For several weeks he has been having the same dream, Mr. Conway says. In this nightmare, he is killing himself in front of his office window with the gun he keeps in his drawer. Not being suicidal, Mr. Conway asks Burton if he has ever encountered cases of murder by suggestion. Mr. Conway wonders if someone could use hypnosis to drive him to suicide by making him dream of ending his life, although he does not remember being hypnotized. He mentions a number of business rivals whom he ruined, and who might want to seek revenge in this perverted manner.<br /> <br /> Burton is taken aback because he has never encountered such a case and admits that he&rsquo;s not sure whether he can help Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway then dismisses the detective and asks him to give back the invitation, as he wants to keep this meeting discreet. However, once Burton is in the hallway, he realizes that he has actually given another letter, addressed to a colleague. Therefore, he goes back to the office, gives the right letter to Mr. Conway, apologizes and goes home.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> A week later, Mr. Conway is found dead by apparent suicide. On the same day, the police called Burton to the scene because his letter of invitation had been found on Mr. Conway&#39;s table. Once he gets there, he notices that the work is finished, and that the workers have done a good job cleaning up, except for a few pieces of glass on the landing of the house that his experienced eye can&rsquo;t help but notice. Mr. Conway used to water the plants on his windowsill at 1 p.m. sharp every day, and the plants had been watered. Therefore, Mr. Conway&#39;s time of death is most likely after 1 p.m. In the house, in addition to the police, are Mr. Conway&#39;s widow, and his daughter from a previous marriage, as well as the butler Murray, the cleaning lady Miss Hurtigan and his secretary Mr. Fisher.<br /> <br /> Burton first tells the police the contents of his conversation with Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway&#39;s widow confirms that her husband had been preoccupied in recent weeks by recurring dreams of suicide. The detective is then introduced to Mr. Conway&#39;s office, which is next to his secretary&rsquo;s, entering through a large carved door. Mr. Conway&#39;s body is lying in front of his open window, holding a revolver in his hand, dead from a bullet to the head. The body was discovered by Mr. Fisher, who had come to bring him a briefcase of documents, followed a few seconds later by Murray, who was alerted by Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s cry. The body is not wearing glasses, which is strange because Mr. Conway, being extremely short-sighted, rarely took off his glasses. This absence of glasses is all the more puzzling because Mr. Conway had a spare pair in case he lost the first one.<br /> <br /> None of the workers heard the shot, which is probably due to them wearing noise-cancelling headphones, the noise of the work, and the heavy door of Mr. Conway office. Despite the back and forth of the workers in front of Conway&#39;s office, no one saw anyone enter Mr. Conway&#39;s office&ndash;except Mr. Conway himself earlier in the morning. For most of the day of the shooting, Betsy Conway and Miss. Conway said they were either in another aisle, as the work near Mr. Conway&rsquo;s office was quite noisy. Mr. Conway has kept working there, thanks to the heavy insulation of his office. Fisher, Murray and Hurtigan, to be able to keep working, had borrowed noise-cancelling headphones from the workers and continued their tasks as usual. As a result, no one seems to have heard the gunshot.<br /> <br /> Mr. Conway&#39;s daughter and widow each inherit half of the deceased&#39;s considerable fortune.

Despite the back and forth of the workers in front of Conway&#39;s office, no one saw anyone enter Mr. Conway&#39;s office&ndash;except Mr. Conway himself earlier in the morning. For most of the day of the shooting, Betsy Conway and Miss. Conway said they were either in another aisle, as the work near Mr. Conway&rsquo;s office was quite noisy. Mr. Conway has kept working there, thanks to the heavy insulation of his office.

Mr. Conway lives in an isolated mansion. When he arrives, Burton sees three workers moving rubble in front of the house. On the steps, the butler, Murray, opens the door and explains that the house is being renovated. He apologizes for the inconvenience, and Burton shows him the invitation he received from Mr. Conway.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> Murray informs Burton that it is standard procedure to introduce visitors first to the office of the secretary who notifies Mr. Conway of their visit, and he brings Burton to the secretary&rsquo;s office. Burton knocks on the door and an authoritative voice tells him to enter. Once inside, a tall, austere, bespectacled man greets the detective, coldly. It is not the secretary who is there, but Mr. Conway. He explains to Burton that he is using his secretary&#39;s office because there is currently work going on in his own office, and asks him to sit. Burton does so, facing a large window, where a strong sun is setting.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> For several weeks he has been having the same dream, Mr. Conway says. In this nightmare, he is killing himself in front of his office window with the gun he keeps in his drawer. Not being suicidal, Mr. Conway asks Burton if he has ever encountered cases of murder by suggestion. Mr. Conway wonders if someone could use hypnosis to drive him to suicide by making him dream of ending his life, although he does not remember being hypnotized. He mentions a number of business rivals whom he ruined, and who might want to seek revenge in this perverted manner.<br /> <br /> Burton is taken aback because he has never encountered such a case and admits that he&rsquo;s not sure whether he can help Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway then dismisses the detective and asks him to give back the invitation, as he wants to keep this meeting discreet. However, once Burton is in the hallway, he realizes that he has actually given another letter, addressed to a colleague. Therefore, he goes back to the office, gives the right letter to Mr. Conway, apologizes and goes home.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> A week later, Mr. Conway is found dead by apparent suicide. On the same day, the police called Burton to the scene because his letter of invitation had been found on Mr. Conway&#39;s table. Once he gets there, he notices that the work is finished, and that the workers have done a good job cleaning up, except for a few pieces of glass on the landing of the house that his experienced eye can&rsquo;t help but notice. Mr. Conway used to water the plants on his windowsill at 1 p.m. sharp every day, and the plants had been watered. Therefore, Mr. Conway&#39;s time of death is most likely after 1 p.m. In the house, in addition to the police, are Mr. Conway&#39;s widow, and his daughter from a previous marriage, as well as the butler Murray, the cleaning lady Miss Hurtigan and his secretary Mr. Fisher.<br /> <br /> Burton first tells the police the contents of his conversation with Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway&#39;s widow confirms that her husband had been preoccupied in recent weeks by recurring dreams of suicide. The detective is then introduced to Mr. Conway&#39;s office, which is next to his secretary&rsquo;s, entering through a large carved door. Mr. Conway&#39;s body is lying in front of his open window, holding a revolver in his hand, dead from a bullet to the head. The body was discovered by Mr. Fisher, who had come to bring him a briefcase of documents, followed a few seconds later by Murray, who was alerted by Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s cry.
