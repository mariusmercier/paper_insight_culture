He ordered the chocolates, poisoned them, and paid a henchman to deliver them to the club. Knowing that Sir William doesn\u2019t like chocolate, he mentioned that he had to find a small gift for his wife, making it natural for Sir William to offer him the chocolates. He was then careful to only eat a few chocolates\u2013even though he would usually have eaten most of the box. If his plan worked well, his wife would die, and Sir William would go to jail for a long time. <br \/> <br \/> Even though both Mr. Beresford and Sir William had a motive, we can tell that Mr. Beresford is the culprit because he was the only one to know that his wife had stopped her diet, and so would eat the chocolates. Since Mrs. Beresford had put an end to this diet a week after she put an end to the affair with Sir William, and they had had no contact since, there was no way for him to know, and thus he would never have planned to poison her with chocolates. <br \/> <br \/> Therefore, Mr. Beresford is the one who killed his wife.\u201d"},"2":{"2":"\u201cThe individual I met a week ago was not Mr. Conway, but his secretary Mr. Fisher, disguised and wearing makeup. It couldn't have been Murray, since he was the one who brought me into the office. Moreover, who else could have used Mr. Fisher's office, knowing that he works there every day. I could not notice the deception because I was partially blinded by the light of the setting sun. <br \/> <br \/> Mr. Fisher dressed up as Edward Conway, welcomed me into the secretary\u2019s office, knowing that the real Mr. Conway would probably be in his own office. Mr. Conway could not hear our conversation because his office is so well insulated. Moreover, Mr. Fisher, having put on Mr. Conway's second pair of glasses, which were unsuitable for his eyesight, did not realize that I had handed him the wrong letter at the end of our interview. <br \/> <br \/> Speaking of this letter, Mr. Fisher has asked me to give it to him before I left, so that the police would find it in Mr. Conway's belongings, interview me, and I would tell this made up story of premonitory dreams, confirming the apparent suicide. The real Mr. Conway would not have kept the letter on his desk for a week, he would have destroyed the letter so that people would not know about our appointment. Mr. Fisher then shot Mr. Conway from his office window, as Mr. Conway was watering the plants.  <br \/> <br \/> Mr. Conway\u2019s glasses fell outside on the landing of the house and shattered there. Later in the day, Mr. Fisher retrieved the frames, but did not diligently clean up the broken glass. Before Murray arrived, Mr. Fisher put the gun hidden in his briefcase into Mr. Conway\u2019s hands. I suspect that Mr. Fisher set it up with the help of Mrs. Conway, the only one to have heard of this whimsical story of dreams. Unable to disguise herself as Mr. Conway to deceive me, Mrs. Conway had to offer Mr. Fisher part of the inheritance in exchange for his help in killing her husband.  <br \/> <br \/> Therefore, I accuse Harry Fisher and Betsy Conway of killing Mr. Conway.\""},"10":{"2":"\u201cBoth the bartender and the waiter might have conspired with the ex-boyfriend to poison Claire. However, the poison is unlikely to have been in one of the straws, since they could not have known which straw Claire would use. However, Claire\u2019s ex-boyfriend knew that she typically slowly sips her drink, while her friend Juliana drinks very quickly. As a result, a way of poisoning Claire and not Juliana was to put poison in the ice, which would be slowly released in the water. This way, only Claire would be poisoned, and not Juliana. Since the bartender is the one who put the ice in the pitcher, it must be him who poisoned Claire.\u201d"}},"Randomization":"Subset","TotalRandSubset":"1"}}},"12":{"Type":"Standard","SubType":"","Description":"end of survey","ID":"BL_eQc1ddQzkMhCZQq","BlockElements":[{"Type":"Question","QuestionID":"QID26"},{"Type":"Question","QuestionID":"QID27"}],"Options":{"BlockLocking":"false","RandomizeQuestions":"false","BlockVisibility":"Expanded"}},"16":{"Type":"Standard","SubType":"","Description":"order","ID":"BL_0CDqce7d8I91pFI","BlockElements":[{"Type":"Question","QuestionID":"QID34"}],"Options":{"BlockLocking":"false","RandomizeQuestions":"false","BlockVisibility":"Collapsed"}},"19":{"Type":"Standard","SubType":"","Description":"Data","ID":"BL_e3EzR4wHN8QPwBE","BlockElements":[{"Type":"Question","QuestionID":"QID96"}],"Options":{"BlockLocking":"false","RandomizeQuestions":"false","BlockVisibility":"Expanded"}},"21":{"Type":"Standard","SubType":"","Description":"instructions","ID":"BL_0SthjaDBoUUAEvA","BlockElements":[{"Type":"Question","QuestionID":"QID54"},{"Type":"Question","QuestionID":"QID73","SkipLogic":[{"SkipLogicID":2,"ChoiceLocator":"q:\/\/QID73\/SelectableChoice\/2","Condition":"Selected","SkipToDestination":"ENDOFSURVEY","Locator":"q:\/\/QID73\/SelectableChoice\/2","SkipToDescription":"Do you understand this feel... <strong>No<\/strong>  <strong>Is Selected<\/strong>","Description":"Condition: <strong title=\"No\">No<\/strong> <strong>Is Selected<\/strong>.

They also found no way for him to have communicated with someone who could have acted for him. That means that he had no opportunity to get the chocolates and poison them. <br \/> <br \/> As we interrogated Mr. Beresford, we found that his behavior during the questioning was suspicious. As a result, we pushed him harder, trying to catch him being inconsistent. After several hours of questioning, he ended up admitting that he was the culprit. He ordered the chocolates to kill his unfaithful wife and have her lover accused and sent to jail. He also told us where to find in his house the bill for the chocolates. We also discovered that Mr. Beresford had accumulated a lot of debt and that his wife's life insurance allowed him to pay it off. <br \/> <br \/> Therefore, Mr. Beresford is the one who killed his wife.\u201d"},"2":{"2":"\u201cI have scrupulously checked the alibi of each of the protagonists. On the day of the murder Murray was working in the basement, he could not tell us at first, but he was accompanied but Miss Hurtigan. The two have a secret relationship that could have gotten them fired if the Conway family found out, since such relationships are prohibited in their employment contracts. Faced with my pressing questions, they finally confessed the truth. <br \/> <br \/> With the help of my partners, I tailed the three remaining suspects for several days. I noticed several meetings between Mr. Fisher and Betsy Conway, the widow. I was even able to take pictures of the two of them kissing furtively at a coffee shop. Not only that, but I also spoke with relatives of Mr. Fisher, who testified that he had told them to be that \u201che was about to hit it big\u201d and that \u201chis life wouldn\u2019t be the same\u201d. Furthermore, I was subsequently contacted by Miss Conway, the daughter of the deceased, who gave me audio recordings she had made of Mr. Fisher and Mrs. Conway explicitly planning the murder of Mr. Conway. <br \/> <br \/> The forensic analysis did not find any gunshot residue on Mr. Conway's temple consistent, which is inconsistent with a suicide. Finally, the scientific department thought of gathering the fingerprints on the revolver found at the crime scene, but not on the bullets loaded into it. I therefore suggested to the detectives that they also gather fingerprints on the bullets. It turns out that Mr. Fisher had wiped his fingerprints off the revolver, but had forgotten to do the same with the bullets he put in the cylinder. <br \/> <br \/> Therefore, I accuse Mr. Fisher and Betsy Conway of killing Mr. Conway.\""},"10":{"2":" \u201cThe police found deleted text messages between the bartender and Claire\u2019s ex-boyfriend, in which they plotted her poisoning.

On several occasions, they talked about \u201ctaking care\u201d by \u201cany means\u201d of Claire. The police profilers also established that Claire's ex-boyfriend was a manipulative person. The bartender is known by police services for previous cases of violence and harassment. Confronted with this evidence, the bartender confessed.

write the question text","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"Sir William, a wealthy middle-aged man in the midst of a bitter divorce, receives at his club a box of chocolates, delivered by an anonymous courier. He has no idea where the chocolates came from, and is all the more surprised that he really doesn&rsquo;t like chocolate. As he looks for someone to give the chocolates to, he turns to his chubby friend at the club, Mr. Beresford. Sir William tells him:&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n- &quot;You mentioned that you were looking for a small gift for your wife, so I&rsquo;d happily give you those, are you interested?&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMr. Beresford replies:<br \/>\n<br \/>\n- &quot;If you&rsquo;d asked me that last week, I would have said, absolutely not, as my wife was until then on a strict no-sugar diet. Fortunately, she&rsquo;s done with that, and we can enjoy delicacies together again. So if you absolutely don&rsquo;t want the chocolate box, I&rsquo;d happily take it off you!&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAs a result, Sir Williams gives Mr. Beresford the chocolate box.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMr. Beresford goes home and, after dinner, he gives his wife the chocolates, and they enjoy a few together while watching a movie. During the night, they both feel sick, and Mr. Beresford manages to call an ambulance. Tragically, Mrs. Beresford dies on the way to the hospital, while Mr. Beresford is severely sick but survives after days of treatment.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe police establish that the death of Mrs. Beresford, and the sickness of her husband, is due to the chocolates, which had been poisoned with nitrobenzene. Given the average dose of nitrobenzene in a chocolate, six chocolates would have been enough to kill an adult. Mrs. Beresford ate a dozen chocolates, while her husband ate only two, which saved his life. Police traced the chocolates back to the small, luxury Maison Fauchon chocolate company that made them. It turns out that Sir William&#39;s box of chocolates was part of a special request from an unknown customer. The delivery man from the Maison Fauchon remembered the order, because he had been specifically instructed to leave the chocolate box in a park bench, which he thought was weird, given that these are expensive chocolates.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe police weren&rsquo;t able to prove anyone&rsquo;s guilt at first, when Mr. Beresford started making some strong accusations. He said that after his wife&rsquo;s death, he found proof that she had been having a passionate affair with Sir William. Looking at the evidence, the police confirmed that this was the case, and they also found, in secret texts that no one had access to, that she had put a stop to the affair two weeks before her death, and that she and Sir William had had no contact since. Mr. Beresford then accused Sir Willam of poisoning his wife, so the affair wouldn&rsquo;t come out, as the latter would then be sure to lose most of his fortune in the divorce proceedings. According to Mr. Beresford, Sir William ordered the chocolates, poisoned them, and then paid a henchman to deliver them to the club. He then found an excuse to give them to someone else, making it look like he was the intended victim.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn spite of these accusations, the police end up arresting Mr. Beresford. Here&rsquo;s the reasoning of the detective behind the arrest:"},"2":{"Display":"The old billionaire Edward Conway has invited the famous detective Richard Burton to his home. Mr. Conway lives in an isolated mansion. When he arrives, Burton sees three workers moving rubble in front of the house. On the steps, the butler, Murray, opens the door and explains that the house is being renovated. He apologizes for the inconvenience, and Burton shows him the invitation he received from Mr. Conway.<br \/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br \/>\nMurray informs Burton that it is standard procedure to introduce visitors first to the office of the secretary who notifies Mr. Conway of their visit, and he brings Burton to the secretary&rsquo;s office. Burton knocks on the door and an authoritative voice tells him to enter. Once inside, a tall, austere, bespectacled man greets the detective, coldly. It is not the secretary who is there, but Mr. Conway. He explains to Burton that he is using his secretary&#39;s office because there is currently work going on in his own office, and asks him to sit. Burton does so, facing a large window, where a strong sun is setting.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFor several weeks he has been having the same dream, Mr. Conway says. In this nightmare, he is killing himself in front of his office window with the gun he keeps in his drawer. Not being suicidal, Mr. Conway asks Burton if he has ever encountered cases of murder by suggestion. Mr. Conway wonders if someone could use hypnosis to drive him to suicide by making him dream of ending his life, although he does not remember being hypnotized. He mentions a number of business rivals whom he ruined, and who might want to seek revenge in this perverted manner.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBurton is taken aback because he has never encountered such a case and admits that he&rsquo;s not sure whether he can help Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway then dismisses the detective and asks him to give back the invitation, as he wants to keep this meeting discreet. However, once Burton is in the hallway, he realizes that he has actually given another letter, addressed to a colleague. Therefore, he goes back to the office, gives the right letter to Mr. Conway, apologizes and goes home.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nA week later, Mr. Conway is found dead by apparent suicide. On the same day, the police called Burton to the scene because his letter of invitation had been found on Mr. Conway&#39;s table. Once he gets there, he notices that the work is finished, and that the workers have done a good job cleaning up, except for a few pieces of glass on the landing of the house that his experienced eye can&rsquo;t help but notice. Mr. Conway used to water the plants on his windowsill at 1 p.m. sharp every day, and the plants had been watered. Therefore, Mr. Conway&#39;s time of death is most likely after 1 p.m. In the house, in addition to the police, are Mr. Conway&#39;s widow, and his daughter from a previous marriage, as well as the butler Murray, the cleaning lady Miss Hurtigan and his secretary Mr. Fisher.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBurton first tells the police the contents of his conversation with Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway&#39;s widow confirms that her husband had been preoccupied in recent weeks by recurring dreams of suicide. The detective is then introduced to Mr. Conway&#39;s office, which is next to his secretary&rsquo;s, entering through a large carved door. Mr. Conway&#39;s body is lying in front of his open window, holding a revolver in his hand, dead from a bullet to the head. The body was discovered by Mr. Fisher, who had come to bring him a briefcase of documents, followed a few seconds later by Murray, who was alerted by Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s cry. The body is not wearing glasses, which is strange because Mr. Conway, being extremely short-sighted, rarely took off his glasses. This absence of glasses is all the more puzzling because Mr. Conway had a spare pair in case he lost the first one.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nNone of the workers heard the shot, which is probably due to them wearing noise-cancelling headphones, the noise of the work, and the heavy door of Mr. Conway office. Despite the back and forth of the workers in front of Conway&#39;s office, no one saw anyone enter Mr. Conway&#39;s office&ndash;except Mr. Conway himself earlier in the morning. For most of the day of the shooting, Betsy Conway and Miss. Conway said they were either in another aisle, as the work near Mr. Conway&rsquo;s office was quite noisy. Mr. Conway has kept working there, thanks to the heavy insulation of his office. Fisher, Murray and Hurtigan, to be able to keep working, had borrowed noise-cancelling headphones from the workers and continued their tasks as usual. As a result, no one seems to have heard the gunshot.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMr. Conway&#39;s daughter and widow each inherit half of the deceased&#39;s considerable fortune. They do not seem particularly distraught, possibly because Mr. Conway was notorious for his bad temper.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nA few days later, Burton contacted the police and told them the following:"},"10":{"Display":"It&#39;s the beginning of a very hot summer, and Claire has just broken up with her boyfriend. They had been together for a very long time, and he took it really hard, becoming nearly abusive. To find a distraction, Claire invited Juliana, her best friend, to go out for drinks together. Juliana insisted on going to the blue lagoon, because they serve delicious, ice cold cocktails here.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAt the blue lagoon, they ordered one large drink to be shared between the two of them. The waiter brought up a small pitcher, put two straws in, and served it to the women. Juliana, as usual, finished her half of the drink very quickly. Claire, by contrast, nearly always sips her drink slowly, and this time was no exception, it was a good half hour later that she had finished the rest of the pitcher.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nShortly after she&rsquo;d finished the drink, Claire started complaining of stomach pain. Julianna called an ambulance. Claire died one hour after arriving at the hospital, where the doctors said that she had been poisoned. Juliana also felt slightly sick, but nothing serious happened to her.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAfter the waiter had brought the drink to their table, no one had gone anywhere near them. On that evening, the bartender was the only one who had access to the drink preparation area, while the waiter was the only one to have access to the drinks after they had been prepared. Both the bartender and the waiter are natural suspects since they were both friends with Claire&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend, who was known to be very jealous and vindictive.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFor the first couple of days, the police can&rsquo;t figure out what happened.

They had been together for a very long time, and he took it really hard, becoming nearly abusive. To find a distraction, Claire invited Juliana, her best friend, to go out for drinks together. Juliana insisted on going to the blue lagoon, because they serve delicious, ice cold cocktails here.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAt the blue lagoon, they ordered one large drink to be shared between the two of them. The waiter brought up a small pitcher, put two straws in, and served it to the women. Juliana, as usual, finished her half of the drink very quickly. Claire, by contrast, nearly always sips her drink slowly, and this time was no exception, it was a good half hour later that she had finished the rest of the pitcher.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nShortly after she&rsquo;d finished the drink, Claire started complaining of stomach pain. Julianna called an ambulance. Claire died one hour after arriving at the hospital, where the doctors said that she had been poisoned. Juliana also felt slightly sick, but nothing serious happened to her.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAfter the waiter had brought the drink to their table, no one had gone anywhere near them. On that evening, the bartender was the only one who had access to the drink preparation area, while the waiter was the only one to have access to the drinks after they had been prepared. Both the bartender and the waiter are natural suspects since they were both friends with Claire&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend, who was known to be very jealous and vindictive.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nDuring the first couple of days, the police can&rsquo;t figure out what happened. A few days later, you read in a newspaper a journalist writing:<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&ldquo;Both the bartender and the waiter might have conspired with the ex-boyfriend to poison Claire. However, the poison is unlikely to have been in one of the straws, since they could not have known which straw Claire would use. However, Claire&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend knew that she typically slowly sips her drink, while her friend Juliana drinks very quickly. As a result, a way of poisoning Claire and not Juliana was to put poison in the ice, which would be slowly released in the water. This way, only Claire would be poisoned, and not Juliana. Since the bartender is the one who put the ice in the pitcher, it must be him who poisoned Claire.&rdquo;<br \/>\n&nbsp;"},"2":{"Display":"Rosie Prescott is a domestic worker working for Laura Fernandez. One day while Ms. Fernandez is working at the office, Rosie is cleaning her boss&#39;s house, with the help of a colleague and friend of hers, Alex Dorian. The two friends chat while working, and end up talking about Roger, the new handyman. Rosie tells her friend that Roger has been in prison for several years, and that she&rsquo;s worried about having an ex-con working in the house. For instance, he has to mow the lawn this afternoon. Unfortunately, Alex tells Rosie that she can&rsquo;t stay with her, since she has to pick up her kids from school at 2.45pm.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMs. Fernandez, who expects guests in the evening, wants to check whether Rosie has been able to come clean the house today. She calls her at 3.15pm. Ms. Fernandez calls repeatedly, but each time the phone rings for a long time with no answer, and she ends up on the answering machine. Ms. Fernandez then remembers that Rosie often puts her phone on silent while she works. After finishing her day at the office, Ms. Fernandez leaves work and arrives at her house at 6pm. There, she is shocked to discover Rosie&#39;s lifeless body in the swimming pool.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMs. Fernandez calls the police, and they arrive soon after. At the bottom of the pool, they find Rosie&rsquo;s purse, containing make-up, a big set of keys, and her cellphone. The officers interrogate various witnesses. Alex said that she had picked up her children from school as planned at 2.45pm, and that she hadn&#39;t seen Rosie after that. Passers-by reported seeing Roger entering Ms. Fernandez&#39;s property at 3pm sharp. Police officers have also caught Roger, who was hiding at a friend&rsquo;s place. When questioned, Roger said that he arrived at 3pm, but that Rosie was already dead. He explained that he had fled because, being a former inmate, he was afraid that her death would be pinned on him.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOne of the officers made the following argument. According to Ms. Fernandez, Rosie&#39;s phone rang at 3.15p.m., meaning it was working then. The phone could not have been in the pool at 3pm, otherwise it wouldn&rsquo;t have rung. The officer concludes that Roger must have lied about Rosie being already dead at 3pm. Forced to admit that he had lied about that, Roger ends up confessing to drowning Rosie in the pool around 3.30pm."},"3":{"Display":"Ms. Aresky is an old lady living alone in a small village. She only has two neighbors, Christian and Magdalena. Magdalena is a small dark-haired woman in her forties, who constantly wears large glasses, and teaches in high school. Christian is a tall and athletic real estate developer in his thirties. One snowy winter evening, Magdalena makes a phone call to the local police station announcing that she has found Ms. Aresky dead.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe police quickly arrive on the scene. They were able to identify the cause of Ms. Aresky&#39;s death. She was killed with a blow to the back of the head. The officers got there on time to avoid a fire, as they found a pot of overcooked, dried up pasta on her gas stove.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe police officers ask Magdalena how she found the body. She explains that as she was walking outside and passing by Ms. Aresky&#39;s house, she decided to say hi. As Ms. Aresky was a bit hard of hearing, and never locked her house, after knocking a few times, she got in. Upon entering she found the lady dead in her kitchen. She is positive that she saw Christian fleeing through the back door. Unfortunately, the heavy snow already covered any footprints there might be in the back. Christian strongly denied his neighbor&#39;s accusations, claiming he was at home that night watching his favorite TV show.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe police found that both Christian and Ms. Aresky had recently made offers in the past to buy the house of Ms. Aresky, in order to extend their respective property. Ms. Aresky had rejected both offers.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nA few days later, the police officer in charge of the case sent the following note to the prosecutor:<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&ldquo;Magdalena wears glasses. She entered Ms. Aresky&#39;s house from the cold, snowy exterior. The house was filled with water vapor from the cooking pasta. Her glasses must have fogged up, and it should be impossible for her to positively identify Christian. Therefore, Magdalena likely lied to us. In light of this, I recommend enquiring further into Magdalena, and making her our prime suspect.&rdquo;<br \/>\n&nbsp;"},"7":{"Display":"Mr. Sanchez&#39;s daughter called the police to report an assault and theft at her father&#39;s house. On the way to Mr. Sanchez&rsquo;s home, police officers almost ran over a man running in the middle of the street from the opposite direction. When the police arrived at her house, police officers saw broken broken glass on the lawn and large dirty footprints inside the house. Mr. Sanchez&rsquo;s safe had been broken into and his jewelry stolen.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMr. Sanchez said that he was woken up by noise coming from his office during the night. According to his testimony, he took his gun and went down the stairs, that&#39;s when he was shot, by an unknown man who missed him. He replied by firing back, also missing his target. After questioning the neighbors, it was confirmed that gunshots were heard late at night.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe man that the police nearly ran over with their car has been arrested. His name is Max, he is a well-known tramp in the neighborhood, very recognizable because he always wears the same military raincoat. He had no weapon on him when he was arrested. He is known to the police, but no witness saw him hanging around that evening near Mr. Sanchez&#39;s house.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nA few month later, the DA sent the following message:<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&ldquo;After a psychiatric examination, experts have established that Max is suffering from anxiety disorder, he was running on the road disoriented after being frightened by the sound of gunshots coming from Mr. Sanchez&#39;s house. Crucially, if the window had been broken from the outside, the broken glass should have been found inside the house and not on the lawn. The window was therefore broken from the inside. Therefore, I charge Mr. Sanchez and his daughter for insurance fraud.&rdquo;<br \/>\n&nbsp;"},"8":{"Display":"On her 85th birthday, wealthy heiress Sarah van den Bruck was murdered in her huge estate in Richmond Valley. Sarah had no children, but she had invited her two nephews, George and Richard, and her niece Mary to spend the week at her place. The three of them are Sarah&rsquo;s only heirs. Sarah was suffering from a severe heart disease. The day of her death she had spent the whole day in bed without seeing anyone. In addition to her disease, Sarah had always been anti-social at times, and was used to remaining alone for long stretches of time, up to 24h or more.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIt was George who found Sarah&#39;s lifeless body in the middle of the night, in her bedroom, stabbed in the chest. He immediately called the police. The latter arrived quickly at the scene of the crime and began to question the three heirs.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nGeorge declared that he had frequent insomnia and that, not being able to sleep, and seeing some light under his aunt&rsquo;s door, he went to check on her, since she had seemed particularly tired the past few days. It was there that he found her murdered. When the police asked him for his alibi, he got angry and claimed that he deeply loved his aunt and had nothing to do with this horrible murder.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nRichard said that he hadn&rsquo;t slept that night either. He was in the library reading books to prepare for his thesis. He was only pulled from his readings when he heard George&#39;s scream and his panicked phone call to the police. He vehemently declared that he had nothing to do with the assassination of his aunt, he even addedthat he didn&rsquo;t care about Sarah&rsquo;s inheritance, being a bohemian scholar.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMary had not spent the night at the house. A police officer called her, and told her that her aunt had died. Mary started crying. She said she had left her aunt&rsquo;s house in the early afternoon the day before to take a flight to New York for an important work meeting. She immediately volunteered that she had no idea who could have stabbed her aunt.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nLater that day, gathering the interested parties in the living room of the mansion, the detective appointed to investigate the case made the following argument:<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&ldquo;Mary not being present when Sarah&#39;s body was found, she could not have known that Sarah had been stabbed. However, as soon as she was told that her aunt was dead, Mary denied knowing who had stabbed her. Therefore, it&rsquo;s very likely that Mary killed Sarah before leaving for New York.&rdquo;<br \/>\n&nbsp;"}},"ChoiceOrder":["1","2","3","8","7"],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"OFF","Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":10,"NextAnswerId":1,"QuestionID":"QID92","DisplayLogic":{"0":{"0":{"ChoiceLocator":"q:\/\/QID7\/SelectableChoice\/1","Description":"<span class=\"ConjDesc\">If<\/span> <span class=\"QuestionDesc\">We invite you to participate in a scientific experiment.

One day while Ms. Fernandez is working at the office, Rosie is cleaning her boss&#39;s house, with the help of a colleague and friend of hers, Alex Dorian. The two friends chat while working, and end up talking about Roger, the new handyman. Rosie tells her friend that Roger has been in prison for several years, and that she&rsquo;s worried about having an ex-con working in the house. For instance, he has to mow the lawn this afternoon. Unfortunately, Alex tells Rosie that she can&rsquo;t stay with her, since she has to pick up her kids from school at 2.45pm.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMs. Fernandez, who expects guests in the evening, wants to check whether Rosie has been able to come clean the house today. She calls her at 3.15pm. Ms. Fernandez calls repeatedly, but each time the phone rings for a long time with no answer, and she ends up on the answering machine. Ms. Fernandez then remembers that Rosie often puts her phone on silent while she works. After finishing her day at the office, Ms. Fernandez leaves work and arrives at her house at 6pm. There, she is shocked to discover Rosie&#39;s lifeless body in the swimming pool.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMs. Fernandez calls the police, and they arrive soon after. At the bottom of the pool, they find Rosie&rsquo;s purse, containing make-up, a big set of keys, and her cellphone. The officers interrogate various witnesses. Alex said that she had picked up her children from school as planned at 2.45pm, and that she hadn&#39;t seen Rosie after that. Passers-by reported seeing Roger entering Ms. Fernandez&#39;s property at 3pm sharp. Police officers have also caught Roger, who was hiding at a friend&rsquo;s place. When questioned, Roger said that he arrived at 3pm, but that Rosie was already dead. He explained that he had fled because, being a former inmate, he was afraid that her death would be pinned on him.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOne of the officers made the following argument. His colleagues had ended up finding Rosie&rsquo;s wallet in the house that Roger was hiding in. The wallet had been carefully hidden in a vent. There is no reason the wallet would have been there, and that Roger would have tried to hide it, if he had nothing to do with the crime. Confronted with that evidence, Roger ends up confessing to drowning Rosie in the pool around 3.30pm."},"8":{"Display":"Ms. Aresky is an old lady living alone in a small village. She only has two neighbors, Christian and Magdalena. Magdalena is a small dark-haired woman in her forties, who constantly wears large glasses, and teaches in high school. Christian is a tall and athletic real estate developer in his thirties. One snowy winter evening, Magdalena makes a phone call to the local police station announcing that she has found Ms. Aresky dead.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe police quickly arrive on the scene. They were able to identify the cause of Ms. Aresky&#39;s death. She was killed with a blow to the back of the head. The officers got there on time to avoid a fire, as they found a pot of overcooked, dried up pasta on her gas stove.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe police officers ask Magdalena how she found the body. She explains that as she was walking outside and passing by Ms. Aresky&#39;s house, she decided to say hi. As Ms. Aresky was a bit hard of hearing, and never locked her house, after knocking a few times, she got in. Upon entering she found the lady dead in her kitchen. She is positive that she saw Christian fleeing through the back door. Unfortunately, the heavy snow already covered any footprints there might be in the back.Christian strongly denied his neighbor&#39;s accusations, claiming he was at home that night watching his favorite TV show.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe police found that both Christian and Ms. Aresky had recently made offers in the past to buy the house of Ms. Aresky, in order to extend their respective property. Ms. Aresky had rejected both offers.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nA few days later, the police officer in charge of the case sent the following note to the prosecutor:<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&ldquo;Christian was able to provide proof that he could not have committed the crime that evening. Indeed, he was with a woman who confirmed his version of the facts. Christian did not immediately mention this woman, because she is married. Therefore, Magdalena likely lied to us.

Sarah had no children, but she had invited her two nephews, George and Richard, and her niece Mary to spend the week at her place. The three of them are Sarah&rsquo;s only heirs. Sarah was suffering from a severe heart disease. The day of her death she had spent the whole day in bed without seeing anyone. In addition to her disease, Sarah had always been anti-social at times, and was used to remaining alone for long stretches of time, up to 24h or more.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIt was George who found Sarah&#39;s lifeless body in the middle of the night, in her bedroom, stabbed in the chest. He immediately called the police. The latter arrived quickly at the scene of the crime and began to question the three heirs.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nGeorge declared that he had frequent insomnia and that, not being able to sleep, and seeing some light under his aunt&rsquo;s door, he went to check on her, since she had seemed particularly tired the past few days. It was there that he found her murdered. When the police asked him for his alibi, he got angry and claimed that he deeply loved his aunt and had nothing to do with this horrible murder.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nRichard said that he hadn&rsquo;t slept that night either. He was in the library reading books to prepare for his thesis. He was only pulled from his readings when he heard George&#39;s scream and his panicked phone call to the police. He vehemently declared that he had nothing to do with the assassination of his aunt, he even addedthat he didn&rsquo;t care about Sarah&rsquo;s inheritance, being a bohemian scholar.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMary had not spent the night at the house. A police officer called her, and told her that her aunt had died. Mary started crying.

She immediately volunteered that she had no idea who could have stabbed her aunt.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nLater that day, gathering the interested parties in the living room of the mansion, the detective appointed to investigate the case made the following argument:<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&ldquo;The knife with which Sarah was stabbed bore Mary&#39;s fingerprints. In addition, we consulted Mary&#39;s company, the latter never had a work meeting planned today. Faced with these facts, Mary did not bear the pressure and confessed to having killed her aunt and forged her will. She indicated the location of the true will to the policeman who found it at the place indicated by her. Therefore, Mary is the one who killed Sarah.&rdquo;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&ldquo;We found Mary&rsquo;s fingerprints, and only hers, on the knife that killed Sarah. Moreover, the forensic physician indicated that the death had taken place the morning before, when Sarah was still in the house.

When he arrives, Burton sees three workers moving rubble in front of the house. On the steps, the butler, Murray, opens the door and explains that the house is being renovated. He apologizes for the inconvenience, and Burton shows him the invitation he received from Mr. Conway.<br \/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br \/>\nMurray informs Burton that it is standard procedure to introduce visitors first to the office of the secretary who notifies Mr. Conway of their visit, and he brings Burton to the secretary&rsquo;s office. Burton knocks on the door and an authoritative voice tells him to enter. Once inside, a tall, austere, bespectacled man greets the detective, coldly. It is not the secretary who is there, but Mr. Conway. He explains to Burton that he is using his secretary&#39;s office because there is currently work going on in his own office, and asks him to sit. Burton does so, facing a large window, where a strong sun is setting.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFor several weeks he has been having the same dream, Mr. Conway says. In this nightmare, he is killing himself in front of his office window with the gun he keeps in his drawer. Not being suicidal, Mr. Conway asks Burton if he has ever encountered cases of murder by suggestion. Mr. Conway wonders if someone could use hypnosis to drive him to suicide by making him dream of ending his life, although he does not remember being hypnotized. He mentions a number of business rivals whom he ruined, and who might want to seek revenge in this perverted manner.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBurton is taken aback because he has never encountered such a case and admits that he&rsquo;s not sure whether he can help Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway then dismisses the detective, and asks him to give back the invitation, as he wants to keep this meeting discreet. However, once Burton is in the hallway, he realizes that he has actually given another letter, addressed to a colleague. Therefore, he goes back to the office, gives the right letter to Mr. Conway, apologizes and goes home.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nA week later, Mr. Conway is found dead by apparent suicide. On the same day, the police called Burton to the scene because his letter of invitation had been found on Mr. Conway&#39;s table. Once he gets there, he notices that the work is finished, and that the workers have done a good job cleaning up, except for a few pieces of glass on the landing of the house that his experienced eye can&rsquo;t help but notice. Mr. Conway used to water the plants on his windowsill at 1 p.m. sharp every day, and the plants had been watered. Therefore, Mr. Conway&#39;s time of death is most likely after 1 p.m. In the house, in addition to the police, are Mr. Conway&#39;s widow, and his daughter from a previous marriage, as well as the butler Murray, the cleaning lady Miss Hurtigan and his secretary Mr. Fisher.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBurton first tells the police the contents of his conversation with Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway&#39;s widow confirms that her husband had been preoccupied in recent weeks by recurring dreams of suicide. The detective is then introduced to Mr. Conway&#39;s office, which is next to his secretary&rsquo;s, entering through a large carved door. Mr. Conway&#39;s body is lying in front of his open window, holding a revolver in his hand, dead from a bullet to the head. The body was discovered by Mr. Fisher, who had come to bring him a briefcase of documents, followed a few seconds later by Murray, who was alerted by Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s cry. The body is not wearing glasses, which is strange because Mr. Conway, being extremely short-sighted, rarely took off his glasses. This absence of glasses is all the more puzzling because Mr. Conway had a spare pair in case he lost the first one.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nNone of the workers heard the shot, which is probably due to them wearing noise-canceling headphones, the noise of the work, and the heavy door of Mr. Conway office. Despite the back and forth of the workers in front of Conway&#39;s office, no one saw anyone enter Mr. Conway&#39;s office&ndash;except Mr. Conway himself earlier in the morning. For most of the day of the shooting, Betsy Conway and Miss. Conway said they were either in another aisle, as the work near Mr. Conway&rsquo;s office was quite noisy. Mr. Conway has kept working there, thanks to the heavy insulation of his office. Fisher, Murray and Hurtigan, to be able to keep working, had borrowed noise-canceling headphones from the workers and continued their tasks as usual. As a result, no one seems to have heard the gunshot.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMr. Conway&#39;s daughter and widow each inherit half of the deceased&#39;s considerable fortune. They do not seem particularly distraught, possibly because Mr. Conway was notorious for his bad temper.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nA few days later, Burton contacted the police and told them the following:<br \/>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-6e84aadd-7fff-ec0a-aeab-d837fc284c23\">&ldquo;The individual I met a week ago was not Mr. Conway, but his secretary Mr. Fisher, disguised and wearing makeup. It couldn&#39;t have been Murray, since he was the one who brought me into the office. Moreover, who else could have used Mr. Fisher&#39;s office, knowing that he works there every day. I could not notice the deception because I was partially blinded by the light of the setting sun. Mr. Fisher dressed up as Edward Conway, welcomed me into the secretary&rsquo;s office, knowing that the real Mr. Conway would probably be in his own office. Mr. Conway could not hear our conversation because his office is so well insulated. Moreover, Mr. Fisher, having put on Mr. Conway&#39;s second pair of glasses, which were unsuitable for his eyesight, did not realize that I had handed him the wrong letter at the end of our interview. Speaking of this letter, Mr. Fisher has asked me to give it to him before I left, so that the police would find it in Mr. Conway&#39;s belongings, interview me, and I would tell this made up story of premonitory dreams, confirming the apparent suicide. The real Mr. Conway would not have kept the letter on his desk for a week, he would have destroyed the letter so that people would not know about our appointment. Mr. Fisher then shot Mr. Conway from his office window, as Mr. Conway was watering the plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-6e84aadd-7fff-ec0a-aeab-d837fc284c23\">Mr. Conway&rsquo;s glasses fell outside on the landing of the house and shattered there. Later in the day, Mr. Fisher retrieved the frames, but did not diligently clean up the broken glass. Before Murray arrived, Mr. Fisher put the gun hidden in his briefcase into Mr. Conway&rsquo;s hands. I suspect that Mr. Fisher set it up with the help of Mrs. Conway, the only one to have heard of this whimsical story of dreams. Unable to disguise herself as Mr. Conway to deceive me, Mrs. Conway had to offer Mr. Fisher part of the inheritance in exchange for his help in killing her husband.&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br \/>\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-6e84aadd-7fff-ec0a-aeab-d837fc284c23\">Therefore, I accuse Harry Fisher and Betsy Conway of killing Mr. Conway.&quot;<\/b><\/p>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"if1_1","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"The old billionaire Edward Conway has invited the famous detective Richard Burton to his home.

When he arrives, Burton sees three workers moving rubble in front of the house. On the steps, the butler, Murray, opens the door and explains that the house is being renovated. He apologizes for the inconvenience, and Burton shows him the invitation he received from Mr. Conway.<br \/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br \/>\nMurray informs Burton that it is standard procedure to introduce visitors first to the office of the secretary who notifies Mr. Conway of their visit, and he brings Burton to the secretary&rsquo;s office. Burton knocks on the door and an authoritative voice tells him to enter. Once inside, a tall, austere, bespectacled man greets the detective, coldly. It is not the secretary who is there, but Mr. Conway. He explains to Burton that he is using his secretary&#39;s office because there is currently work going on in his own office, and asks him to sit. Burton does so, facing a large window, where a strong sun is setting.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFor several weeks he has been having the same dream, Mr. Conway says. In this nightmare, he is killing himself in front of his office window with the gun he keeps in his drawer. Not being suicidal, Mr. Conway asks Burton if he has ever encountered cases of murder by suggestion. Mr. Conway wonders if someone could use hypnosis to drive him to suicide by making him dream of ending his life, although he does not remember being hypnotized. He mentions a number of business rivals whom he ruined, and who might want to seek revenge in this perverted manner.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBurton is taken aback because he has never encountered such a case and admits that he&rsquo;s not sure whether he can help Mr. Conway. Mr. Conway then dismisses the detective, and asks him to give back the invitation, as he wants to keep this meeting discreet. However, once Burton is in the hallway, he realizes that he has actually given another letter, addressed to a colleague. Therefore, he goes back to the office, gives the right letter to Mr. Conway, apologizes and goes home.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nA week later, Mr. Conway is found dead by apparent suicide.

On the day of the murder Murray was working in the basement, he could not tell us at first, but he was accompanied but Miss Hurtigan. The two have a secret relationship that could have gotten them fired if the Conway family found out, since such relationships are prohibited in their employment contracts. Faced with my pressing questions, they finally confessed the truth. With the help of my partners, I tailed the three remaining suspects for several days. I noticed several meetings between Mr. Fisher and Betsy Conway, the widow. I was even able to take pictures of the two of them kissing furtively at a coffee shop. Not only that, but I also spoke with relatives of Mr. Fisher, who testified that he had told them to be that &ldquo;he was about to hit it big&rdquo; and that &ldquo;his life wouldn&rsquo;t be the same&rdquo;. Furthermore, I was subsequently contacted by Miss Conway, the daughter of the deceased, who gave me audio recordings she had made of Mr. Fisher and Mrs. Conway explicitly planning the murder of Mr. Conway. The forensic analysis did not find any gunshot residue on Mr. Conway&#39;s temple consistent, which is inconsistent with a suicide. Finally, the scientific department thought of gathering the fingerprints on the revolver found at the crime scene, but not on the bullets loaded into it. I therefore suggested to the detectives that they also gather fingerprints on the bullets. It turns out that Mr. Fisher had wiped his fingerprints off the revolver, but had forgotten to do the same with the bullets he put in the cylinder. Therefore, I accuse Mr. Fisher and Betsy Conway of killing Mr. Conway.&quot;<\/b><br \/>\n&nbsp;","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"if0_1","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"The old billionaire Edward Conway has invited the famous detective Richard Burton to his home.
